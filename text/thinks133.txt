This is my family. My grandmother's name is Maria, and my grandfather is Jose. Then there's my father, Pablo, and my mother Susana. I've got a brother and a sister - my sister is Ana and my brother is Antonio.
My mother's brother is Jaime - he's my uncle. His wife is Marta, my aunt. They've got a daughter called Sara - she's my cousin.
