PRESENTER: Hello, and welcome to our programme. Today we are talking about different dances around the world. Is there a dance that you really like? Phone and tell us. Our first caller is Janie. OK Janie, what's your dance?
JANIE: Hello. Well, my family goes to Spain every year and I love Flamenco. It's wonderful! I love listening to the guitar. And the women in their beautiful dresses - red or blue or black! They look fantastic.
PRESENTER: Yes, thanks, Janie. I like watching Flamenco too. And now here's Graham. Hi Graham, what's your favourite dance?
GRAHAM: Hi there. Well I go to Turkey a lot and sometimes I see the dance called the Whirling Dervishes. There are four, five or six men who wear big skirts of different colours. And as the music plays, they dance in circles round and round - they don't stop! It's really interesting.
PRESENTER: Thanks, Graham. And now here's David.
DAVID: Hi there. My favourite dance is the Kecak - you can see it in Bali in Indonesia. A lot of men sit in a circle - there isn't any music, but the men repeat the word 'kecak' and they move their arms in the air.
PRESENTER: Is it only men who dance?
DAVID: Yes, it is. And only for tourists, really.
PRESENTER: OK. Thank you, David, and everyone!
