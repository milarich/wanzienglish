PETER Could you ride a bike when you were
young, Grandma?
GRANDMA I certainly could, Peter. I went to school
on my bike. I put my books in the basket.
PETER Could you swim?
GRANDMA Of course I could !
PETER Were you good?
GRANDMA I was very good! I swam across the lake.
Look - here's a photo my father took
when I finished.
PETER Wow, Grandma. I couldn't do that!
