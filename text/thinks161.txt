One day Delaney is very tired and feels bad. Her mum and dad take her to hospital. The doctors check the girl. They say that Delaney is very ill. She's got cancer. Her parents are very worried.
Delaney is in hospital for months. It's a very difficult time for her, but she often smiles. The doctors and nurses like her a lot. She's a very strong girl.
Delaney looks very different now. She hasn't got any hair. But she's got a real friend, Kamryn. Kamryn talks to her parents. She wants to help Delaney. She wants to look like Delaney. Delaney feels different from her classmates. Kamryn shaves her head. When Delaney sees her friend without hair, she's very happy. She's got a really good friend. Now Delaney isn't alone.
But there is a terrible surprise for Kamryn the next day at school. Her teachers say it isn't OK to have a shaved head. They don't want Kamryn to go to school with a shaved head.
A lot of people don't understand the teachers, and they tell the school what they think. The newspapers have got lots of stories about the two girls.  
In the end, the teachers say it's OK. Kamryn goes back to school.
