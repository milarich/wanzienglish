Erin and Tonk to the rescue
 
Erin Bolster was a guide in Glacier Park in Montana, USA. In July 2011, she took a group of eight people on horses for a ride in the woods. Erin was on a big white horse called Tonk.
Everyone was ready to have fun, and the ride started well. Erin knew there were bears in the woods, but they didn't usually go near people.
Suddenly, an angry, 300 kg grizzly bear came out from the trees. It was very near to an eight year-old boy who was on his horse. The boy's horse saw the bear and got very scared. It ran away with the boy on its back. The bear ran after them.
Tonk was scared, too - he didn't want to move. But Erin needed to help the boy. She didn't stop to think. She gave Tonk a kick, and they went after the bear.
She found the bear near the boy and his horse. Then the boy fell off the horse and the bear started to go towards him! Erin put Tonk between the bear and the boy.
