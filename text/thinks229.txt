The pizza
 
DAD: So what are you doing, boys?
DAN: Tom is making pizza for the girls, and I'm helping him.
TOM: Is that OK, Dad?
DAD: Of course. No problem. You make great pizza! What time do they get here?
TOM: Six o'clock. We've got half an hour.
 
DAD: Do you want some help, Tom?
TOM: No, I'm OK, thanks. OK, first we need to add the tomato sauce.
DAN: I can cut the peppers. 
DAD: OK. Just be careful with the knife.
 
TOM: What are you doing, Dad!?
DAD: I'm putting a bit of cheese on the pizza.
DAN: Don't do that!
DAD: Too late.
 
DAD: It's only cheese.
DAN: The thing is, Ruby hates cheese.
DAD: Oh dear.
TOM: Now what?
DAD: We can't make another one. We haven't got time.
TOM: What can we do?
