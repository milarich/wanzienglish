MAN: Good morning. How can I help you?
AMY: Good morning. I want to go to Brighton. What time's the next train?
MAN: The next one is at quarter past nine.
AMY: And the one after that?
MAN: There's one at 9.40. But that's the slower train. It stops everywhere.
AMY: Hmm, that's not so good.
MAN: But if you wait for another five minutes you can get the 9.45. That's much quicker.
AMY: What time does that one arrive in Brighton?
MAN: At quarter to eleven.
AMY: Quarter to eleven. And how much is a ticket to Brighton?
MAN: Do you want a single or a return?
AMY: A return ticket please.
MAN: Returning today?
AMY: No, I want to come back on Friday.
MAN: Friday. Ok, that's GBP16.40, please.
AMY: What platform does the train leave from?
MAN: Platform 13. It's on the other side of the bridge.
AMY: And do you know what platform it arrives at in Brighton.
MAN: The platform it arrives at?
AMY: Yes, my mum wants to meet me off the train there.
MAN: Ok, let me see. The 9.45.... arrives in Brighton at platform...9.
AMY: Platform 9. I'll text my mum. Thank you so much.
MAN: You're welcome. And have a good journey.
