The big match
 
TOM: It's the big match this afternoon. Why don't we all watch it together?
RUBY: Great idea!
TOM: OK. You call Ellie and I can call Dan. About 3.30 at my place!
RUBY: Hmm, I've got some stuff to do first, but I think 3.30 is OK.
 
 
MAN ON TV: Welcome to today's match. We're here live in London!
ELLIE: It's so exciting.
DAN: I know. I love football.
TOM: The US can win this. I know it. Go USA!
RUBY: No way, Tom. Go England!
 
RUBY: Hey. The TV screen. Is it broken? We can't see anything.
ELLIE: Where's the match? We want to watch the match!
DAN: Come on, Tom. Do something! The match starts in a few minutes!
TOM: Just a minute. Let me try and fix it.
 
TOM: Oh, no. Now the screen's black.
DAN: Now what do we do?
TOM: It's no big deal. I'm sure I can fix it.
RUBY: This is terrible!
