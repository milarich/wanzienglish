IAN: Hey, Becky. Did you have a good holiday?
BECKY: Hi, Ian. Yes, thanks, it was awesome.
IAN: Where did you go?
BECKY: Belize.
IAN: Where?
BECKY: Belize. It's in central America. South of Mexico.
IAN: Oh, right. So why did you go there?
BECKY: Because there are amazing animals and birds there. We all love animals in my family. In fact my dad worked in a zoo a long time ago.
IAN: Oh I didn't know that. So, did you see any exciting animals?
BECKY: Yes, we did! Lots. We wanted to see cats, but ....
IAN: Cats? They're not exciting. We've got cats at home!
BECKY: Don't be silly. I mean big cats.
IAN: Big cats - like tigers?
BECKY: That's right, but there aren't any tigers in Belize. But they've got jaguars there!
