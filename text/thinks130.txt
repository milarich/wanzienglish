CONNOR: What's the matter, Nick? Are you tired?
NICK: Tired? No, no. I'm not tired. I'm bored.
CONNOR: Why are you bored?
NICK: Because there's nothing to do. Nothing to do at all.
CONNOR: Well, there's a Formula One race at five. It's on TV.
NICK: Formula One? I don't like it.
CONNOR: Really? What about a film? There's a new film on at the cinema.
NICK: A film? Who's in it?
CONNOR: Ben Stiller. He's so funny.
NICK: Ben Stiller? I don't like him. He's not funny. He's terrible.
CONNOR: Erm. What about some music? Listen to this song. It's the new one from One Direction.
NICK: One Direction! Are you joking? I don't like them.
CONNOR: Well do you like ice cream? The new ice cream shop in town is open.
NICK: Ice cream? No, I don't like it.
CONNOR: What! You don't like ice cream?
