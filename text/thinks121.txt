JAMIE: Nice shirt.
MARTA: Thank you. It's the new Barcelona shirt.
JAMIE: I know. I'm a Barcelona fan too. So what's your name?
MARTA: Marta. And what's your name?
JAMIE: I'm Jamie.
MARTA: Nice to meet you, Jamie.
JAMIE: Nice to meet you too. Where are you from, Marta?
MARTA: I'm from Spain. I'm from a small town called Teruel.
JAMIE: Spain is a beautiful country.
MARTA: Yes, it is. So who's your favourite Barcelona player?
JAMIE: Umm. Er. Tony Kroos.
MARTA: The German player?
JAMIE: Yes, he's great.
MARTA: Yes he is. But he isn't a Barcelona player.
JAMIE: No?
MARTA: He's a Real Madrid player.
JAMIE: Oh!
MARTA: It's late. Time to go. Bye, Jamie.
JAMIE: Oh, OK!
