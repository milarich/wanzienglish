The Other Final
 
It's 30th June 2002. In the International Stadium in Yokohama, Japan, two great teams, Brazil and Germany, are ready to play in the World Cup final. 
4,500 kilometres away in the Changlimithang Stadium in Thimphu, Bhutan, there is another football match; Bhutan vs. Montserrat. Bhutan are number 202 in the world, Montserrat are 203. They are the bottom two teams in the world.
It's Matthijs de Jongh's idea. He's a Dutch businessman. He can't watch his national team, the Netherlands, because they are not at this World Cup. He's sad but then he thinks about people from other countries. What about teams that never play in the World Cup? He organises 'the other final' and asks the national teams of Bhutan and Montserrat to play. The Montserrat team fly from the Caribbean to the Himalayan mountains of Bhutan. Thousands of people watch the match. Bhutan win 4 - 0 but everyone decides that football is the real winner.
After their game both teams sit down with the rest of the world and enjoy the real World Cup final.
