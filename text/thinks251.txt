My favourite Journey
 
CONNOR: Every year my family goes on holiday to a small town by the sea. It's got really beautiful beaches and we always have a great time. I love the journey there. We always go by train. It takes about four hours but I don't mind the time. I'm always so excited. I just love watching the mountains and forests go past.
 
JULIA: What's my favourite journey? Any one with my mum on her motorbike. I don't care where we go, I just love being on her bike. She's a really good rider and I always feel safe. I love the wind on my face as we ride through the countryside.
 
MIRIAM: My favourite journey is my walk to school. We live on a farm and my school is about one kilometre away. Every morning I walk across the fields and then along the river until I'm at my school in the village. It's a really beautiful walk and it's so quiet. I love my walk to school ... but I love the walk home more!
 
NATHAN: My grandparents live in New York. We visit them every year and, of course, we go by plane. It's a ten hour journey but I love it. I love travelling by plane. It's so exciting. I never get bored because there are lots of films to watch. They always have really good ones.
