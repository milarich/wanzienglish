A lot of big cities, like London, have got many traffic problems. Sometimes a journey of a few kilometres can take more than an hour. So what's the best way to get across London? For a very short journey, it's probably a good idea to walk. But what happens when you want to go further?
 
The presenters of a popular TV car show decided to find out. Each of the presenters chose a different type of transport to make the same 27 km journey. One presenter went by bike. One went by car. Another chose public transport - the underground and the bus - and the last one travelled by speedboat up the River Thames. They all started at the same time and the same place in West London, but who got to City Airport in East London first?
 
The results were a surprise. The bike came first. In second place was the speedboat. Public transport came third and the car was last.
 
So the presenters had an answer. The bike was quicker than all the other types of transport and the car was slower. They weren't very happy with the result because they wanted the car to win. They made a joke and said the bike wasn't a real winner because it was more dangerous.
 
But, of course, the bike is the real winner. It's the best way to get about. It's cheaper than public transport and healthier for you than a car. It's also better for our cities because bikes don't pollute the air. So next time you need to go into town, think before you and your parents get into the car 'Can we make this journey by bike?'
