VICKY: Hi, Freddie.
FREDDIE: Hi. How are you?
VICKY: Well, I'm fine, but how are you? We were all at the cinema on Saturday evening. Only you weren't there. Where were you?
FREDDIE: I'm sorry. I was... erm... at a birthday party.
VICKY: OK. Whose birthday was it?
FREDDIE: Oh you don't know her. She's a good friend of mine. Her name's Lara.
VICKY: OK. Was it a good party?
FREDDIE: Oh, yeah. It was fantastic.
VICKY: Great. Were there a lot of people?
FREDDIE: No, there weren't. There were only 12 people, but they were all cool.
VICKY: Why were they so cool?
