Welcoming people around the world
 
What do you do when you see someone you know? Do you smile? Do you say hello? Do you touch the other person?
Here are some ideas for travellers. They tell you how people in different countries and cultures welcome each other. Do you do different things in your country?
In many countries in the East, people bow their heads when they greet each other. This shows respect and in China is called 'kowtow'. In Thailand, people put their hands together and bow. This is called the 'wai'.
When people in Tibet greet each other, they stick out their tongue. This is a very old tradition. But you can still see it in Tibet today.
In Mongolia, people give a 'hada' to guests who visit their home. This is a piece of silk. When you get a 'hada', hold it in both hands. This also shows respect.
The Maori people in New Zealand rub noses together when they meet. This is called the 'hongi'.
In Western countries, many people shake hands when they greet each other. Sometimes they just smile and say something like 'Hello!' or 'Hi!' 
In many countries around the world friends greet by kissing on the cheek. In some countries they do it on one cheek, in others they do it on two cheeks and in some they kiss cheeks three times.
