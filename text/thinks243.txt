Extinct animals
 
1 The dodo
WOMAN: The dodo was a bird. It lived on the island of Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean. At one time there were thousands of them on the island. Then people from Europe arrived and started to eat them. The Europeans took animals such as dogs and cats to the island, and the animals ate the dodo eggs. So, why didn't the dodo fly away from the people? Because it couldn't fly. And in 1681, it became extinct.
 
2 The sabre-toothed cat
MAN: This dangerous cat lived thousands of years ago, in North and South America. It had two very big teeth that it used to kill animals. You could see these teeth even when the cat's mouth was closed. People think that this cat could kill very big animals. It became extinct around 10,000 BCE because there wasn't enough food for it.
 
3 The woolly rhinoceros
WOMAN: This very big animal lived in the middle of Europe and Asia until about 8,000 BCE. It had two horns - the big one was sometimes one metre long. It had a thick woolly coat, so it could keep warm in the cold winters. But then the weather changed a lot and the woolly rhinoceros couldn't live in the warm weather. Also, many people killed them for food. So they died out.
