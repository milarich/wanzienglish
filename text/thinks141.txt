Window of the World
 
In the city of Shenzhen in China, there is a park called Window of the World. In the park there are many models of famous places from around the world. There are towers, like the Eiffel Tower in Paris, mountains, like Mount Fuji in Japan, monuments, like the Statue of Liberty in New York, and other places, too. Together there are one hundred and thirty different models. But there aren't any people living in the park! Here are some things you can see there:
Niagara Falls in North America
the Temple of the Emerald Buddha in Thailand
the Pyramids in Egypt
St Mark's Square in Venice.
Are there any fun activities? Yes, there are: for example, you can take a ride on the Colorado River! And there is a place for skiing too! And every year, on China's National Day (October 1st) there is a pop festival in the park. Take a taxi or bus from Shenzhen train station to get there. It costs 180 renminbi to go in - that's about US$28.00. There are some restaurants and cafs in the park with different types of food. Or, take something to eat with you.
