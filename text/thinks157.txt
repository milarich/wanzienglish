Tim
TIM: I always use my tablet to help me with my homework. There are lots of great websites to find out information. I like the Discovery kids site. The BBC has a good one for teenagers too. The best thing is it's free so it doesn't cost anything.
 
Shona
SHONA: We've got a big TV in our living room but we never watch it together in our house. My brother and I use it to play games on a lot. We watch TV on the computer. We just choose what we want to watch and when we want to watch it. It's so easy.
 
Julia
JULIA: I use my laptop mainly for computer games. My favourite is Minecraft. In Minecraft you build things -houses, bridges, shops - anything you want. I sometimes play online with my friends and we build things together. It's really cool. The only problem is when mum calls me for dinner. I don't want to stop.
 
Harry
HARRY: I sometimes make calls on my phone but most of the time I use it to text my friends because it doesn't cost a lot of money. I also use my phone to play games on when I'm bored. It's great when you've got a long car journey.
