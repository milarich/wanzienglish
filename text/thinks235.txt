My grandmother lived in the country. She walked to
town to go to school. She finished school when she
was twelve. She started working in a bottle factory.
She worked in the factory until she married my
grandfather. One day, she invented a machine that
cleaned bottles. The factory wanted the machine and
my grandparents were rich after that!
