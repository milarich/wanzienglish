MAN 3: Excuse me - can I get a bus from here to the shopping centre?
WOMAN 3: Oh, don't take a bus - the shopping centre's only two minutes from here.
MAN 3: Really? OK. But how do I get there?
WOMAN 3: Just go along this street and take the second road on the left.
MAN 3: Second on the left. Great.
