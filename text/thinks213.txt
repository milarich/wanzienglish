ALEX: Hey, something is happening. A woman is sitting on a chair and she is playing a violin. What's this?! It's a flash mob in the supermarket!

ALEX: Wow. This is fantastic! Now about ten men and women are standing here and they're playing music on violins and trumpets and things.

ALEX: I'm looking at the other people in the supermarket. They're surprised but they like the music. They aren't thinking about food now!

ALEX: Mum says that the music is Handel??!! She isn't shopping now - she's standing with me and we're listening. I'm not bored now!

ALEX: OK it's over. All the people here are smiling and talking about the music. The musicians and singers are leaving. What a great morning!
