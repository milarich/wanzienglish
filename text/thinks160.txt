The school play
 
RUBY: Where are Tom and Ellie?
DAN: They're at drama club. They're in the school play, remember.
RUBY: Oh that's right. They're amazing.
DAN: What do you mean?
RUBY: To be in a play in front of all the school.
 
DAN: Look. Here they are. They don't look very happy.
RUBY: Hi, guys. What's wrong?
TOM: It's Anna Williams. She's in the play but she's ill.
ELLIE: We really need her. The play is on Friday.
 
ELLIE: I've got an idea. Ruby, do you want to be in the play? You can have Anna's part.
RUBY: Me! No way.
TOM: Oh, come on, Ruby. Please. We really need you.
DAN: Do it, Ruby. Help your friends.
 
RUBY: Oh, OK.
ELLIE: I love you, Ruby! Thank you so much.
TOM: Yes, you're the best.
RUBY: Am I crazy?
