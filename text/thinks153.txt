I love Glee club!
 
Our school has a Glee club and it's brilliant. I know this because I'm a member! So what is a Glee club? Simple - it's a club for singing and I love singing.
 
Miss Higgins is the club leader. She chooses the songs and helps us to sing them. She plays the piano too. She's really cool and she's really kind. She never gets angry with us. She's not even the school music teacher. She teaches maths. But she just loves singing.
 
We often sing popular songs from films but we sometimes sing old songs from the 1960s and 1970s. Three times a year we perform our songs in front of the rest of the school in a special concert. I feel so happy when I'm on stage. The teachers and the other students always cheer when we finish. It feels wonderful.
 
I love Glee club. Music is a great way to bring people together. You make so many friends at Glee club and not just with people from your school year. Glee club is for all ages.
 
We meet in the school hall every Tuesday at lunchtime and every Friday after school. Come and join us - we are always happy to see new people!
