Harry doesn't want to be a star chef when he's 20. He wants to be one now. This is why he's on the Star Junior Chefs TV programme.
The ten-year-old New Yorker likes cooking. He can make fantastic soups and salads, excellent omelettes and the best cakes. But there are many other children on the show, too. And they are all very good.
More and more young people are interested in cooking. Many of them learn it from their parents. Others watch special cooking videos for children on YouTube. In many cities, there are special cooking classes for young people. Some of them are for children from the age of three!
But what must you do to become a star chef? Of course it's important that you like cooking and are really good at it. But there are some rules. You must be nine years old or more to be on Star Junior Chefs. 'We must wash our hands before we start cooking,' Harry says. 'And of course we mustn't put them in our mouths. A chef doesn't do that! And we must be very careful with hot plates.'
The show starts. Harry is excited. He knows he's an excellent cook. This time he makes tomato soup, some salad, steak, and carrot cake. The experts in the studio love Harry's food, and he stays on the show.
It's 5 pm. The show is over. Harry is happy, and a little tired. He goes home. It's time to do his homework.
