WOMAN: Hi Ella.
ELLA: Hello.
WOMAN: Can I ask you a question?
ELLA: OK.
WOMAN: Have you got a hobby?
ELLA: Yes, I have. I've got three actually. I listen to music a lot. I go swimming. And I make friendship bands.
WOMAN: Wow, you make them?
ELLA: Yes, I do.
WOMAN: How many friendship bands have you got?
ELLA: Not a lot. Only five or six. I always give them away. I give them     to my friends.
WOMAN: OK. Have you got lots of friends?
ELLA: Erm. I've got two or three very good friends. And I'm friends with most of the girls and boys in my class, so about 25 altogether.
WOMAN: How much time do you spend on your hobby?
ELLA: On making friendship bands? Hmm. I don't know. An hour a day maybe.
WOMAN: And how much money do you spend on it?
ELLA: Not a lot. I use rubber bands. And they aren't expensive.
WOMAN: How many colours do you use for your bands?
ELLA: Sometimes I use only one or two colours. And I sometimes use seven or eight. Have a look at this one. It's got eight different colours.
WOMAN: Wow. It's beautiful. Congratulations!
ELLA: Thank you.
