AGATA: So, this is my bedroom. Do you like it?
DEBBIE: Yes! It's really nice. I like your bed. And the curtains are great!
AGATA: Thank you. I like my room, too. It's my favourite room in the house - of course!
DEBBIE: That is a nice photograph. There, on the desk.
AGATA: Yes, it's me and my family, on holiday in Ibiza. We're all very happy in that photograph!
DEBBIE: Cool. And is that your brother?
AGATA: Yes, it is. That is Brian.
DEBBIE: Oh, he's nice.
AGATA: Hmm... sometimes he is, sometimes he isn't.
BRIAN: Agata! Are you in here?
AGATA: Hi Brian. Yes, I'm here. And this is my friend Debbie.
BRIAN: Hello, Debbie. Listen, Agata - are these your things?
AGATA: What things?
BRIAN: The books and magazines.
AGATA: Oh yes, sorry.
BRIAN: And Agata, the DVDs on your bed - those are my DVDs!
AGATA: Yes, you're right. Sorry again.
BRIAN: You know something, Debbie? Sometimes my sister isn't my favourite person!
