JENNY: Oh no!
PEDRO: What's the matter?
JENNY: My phone? Where is it? It was in my jacket!
PEDRO: OK, calm down. Where was your phone this morning?
JENNY: Well, I was at home from nine o'clock to ten o'clock.
PEDRO: And then? Were you in town?
JENNY: Yes, I was. I was in the shopping centre. And I'm 100% sure that my phone was in my pocket.
PEDRO: Were Steve and Maisie with you?
JENNY: No, they weren't. I was in the shoe shop. I bought some new shoes.
PEDRO: Wait a minute. Let me call you.
JENNY: It's ringing! Oh, look, it's in the shoe bag! It was there all the time!
