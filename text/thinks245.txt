The Spider
 
TOM: I had a really good time yesterday.
DAN: Yeah? What did you do?
TOM: I took the dog for a walk in the forest. It was really fun.
ELLIE: That sounds nice.
 
ELLIE: What about you, Ruby? What did you do yesterday?
TOM: Ruby? What's the matter? Did something bad happen?
RUBY: Yes. Oh, it was horrible. I don't want to talk about it.
TOM: Come on, Ruby. We're your friends. What happened?
 
RUBY: Well, last night I went into my bedroom, and suddenly I saw... oh, it's stupid.
ELLIE: What, Ruby? What? Tell us!
RUBY: All right. I sat down and there was a spider on my bed, right beside me! A big, fat, black spider.
ELLIE: Poor you!
DAN: Ha, ha, ha, ha! You're afraid of spiders? I don't believe it!
ELLIE: Dan! Don't be horrible! Don't say things like that. 
RUBY: I hate spiders, Dan! I'm really, really afraid of them!
 
TOM: That wasn't very nice, Dan. Tell her you're sorry.
DAN: Oh, come on. It's silly to be scared of spiders.
TOM: But she's really angry with you now.
DAN: I've got a great idea, Tom! Let's play a joke on her.
TOM: Oh, no! Don't look at me!
