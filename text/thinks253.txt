POLLY: Hey, Seth. Is that your dog?
SETH: No, Polly, it's my mum's. He's called Spot. I'm taking him for a walk.
POLLY: Have you got a pet?
SETH: Yes, I've got a rabbit called Flopsie and a cat called Spike.
POLLY: I had a rabbit. Her name was Dolly. She died last year.
SETH: Oh, I'm sorry.
POLLY: It's ok. I've got a fish now.
SETH: A fish?
POLLY: Yes, Nemo. He's easier to look after than a rabbit. He only eats once     a day.
SETH: Really. Spike eats two times a day and Flopsie eats three times.
POLLY: And I only have to clean his bowl once a week. It's no trouble at all.
SETH: I think I want a fish.
