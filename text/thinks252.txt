Transport around the World
 
The Bamboo train, Cambodia
WOMAN: This simple train is made from pieces of bamboo. Local people use it to travel and move things from one village to another. It's got an engine on it and wheels from old trains. It uses the same rails as the national trains and it's a quick way to travel. But be careful: when you hear a train coming, get out of the way quickly!
 
The Tuktuk, Thailand
MAN: Tuktuks are originally from Thailand but they are popular in many Asian countries. They've got three wheels and an engine. The noise the engine makes gives the tuktuk its name. They are big enough for two to four people and a suitcase and they are often used for making short trips across busy cities. They're small so they can go through the crowded streets quickly. The journey is often a little dangerous but always exciting.
 
The Zorb, New Zealand
WOMAN: The zorb is not really a type of transport but it is a fun way of getting about. The zorb is a big plastic ball. One person gets inside and the zorb then rolls down the hill. There's a cushion of air to protect the person. It's an exciting way of getting down a hill but it isn't so good for getting up again!
