It was her dream to be an astronaut
 
Valentina Tereshkova was born in Russia on 6 March, 1937. Her father was a driver and her mother was a factory worker. Valentina was a worker in a factory too. Her hobby was sky diving and it was her dream to be an astronaut and to go into space.
 
In 1962, there was a big competition to find new astronauts. There were four hundred people interested in going to space. The training programme wasn't very easy, but Tereshkova was hard working. She was the lucky one. Tereshkova's big day was 16 June, 1963, and she was ready.
 
The name of her spacecraft was Vostok 6, and Tereshkova was the first woman in space. The flight was very difficult because there were many technical problems and Tereshkova wasn't very well for most of the flight. She was in space for three days. She is the only woman to do a solo space flight. After that she was very famous all over the world. Her face was on stamps in several countries.
 
In the year 2000, there was a big celebration in London and Valentina Tereshkova was named the 'Woman of the Century'.
 
At the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Russia in 2014, Valentina Tereshkova was one of the carriers of the Olympic flag.
 
These moments were very important to her.
