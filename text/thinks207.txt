LUCY: Hi, Sam, it's me Lucy.
SAM: Hi, Lucy. How's it going?
LUCY: Do you want to go surfing?
SAM: Go surfing. Great. What time?
LUCY: How about after lunch, say two o'clock? 
SAM: Two o'clock. No. Sorry, I can't. I've got a volleyball match.
LUCY: Ok, how about three o'clock?
SAM: Volleyball only finishes at half past three.
LUCY: Let's say four o'clock then?
SAM: I can't. Dad wants to give me a golf lesson.
LUCY: Until what time?
SAM: About quarter to five.
LUCY: Really? But we can't go surfing then. It gets dark at half past.
