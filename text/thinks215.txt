MAGGIE: Hi, Mike. Are you enjoying the party?
MIKE: Hey, Maggie. Yes, it's OK. But I don't like the music.
MAGGIE: Oh, the music's OK! Hey! Come and dance! I really like dancing!
MIKE: No, thanks. I don't like dancing very much. Ask Andy to dance with you. He's a really good dancer.
MAGGIE: Andy? Who's Andy?
MIKE: He's over there. Look - he's wearing grey trousers and a green shirt. Can you see him?
MAGGIE: Oh, yes, I can see him. A green shirt!! Ugh!
MIKE: Oh, it's just a shirt! Go and ask him to dance.
MAGGIE: No. I hate talking to boys.
MIKE: But you're talking to me.
MAGGIE: I know, but you're my friend. That's different. I don't know Andy. And ... he's wearing a green shirt!
MIKE: You're crazy. Andy is really nice. He loves going to parties, and dancing ... and meeting new people. Oh look, he's coming over here.
ANDY: Hi. I'm Andy.
MAGGIE: Oh, hi. I'm Maggie. Do you like dancing?
ANDY: Yes, I love it! Do you want to dance?
MAGGIE: Yes, OK! Oh, and I like your shirt!
MIKE: What? Wow. I really don't understand!
