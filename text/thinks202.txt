WOMAN: Nikolai Kutsenko can do amazing things with a football. He can kick a ball well ... but he can also keep the ball in the air with his feet, legs and head. Lots of footballers can do this. But can they do it for 24 hours and 30 minutes without stopping? Nikolai can and it's a world record.
 
MAN: Xavier Good is three years old. He's a little boy and there are a lot of things he can't do. He can't read or write, for example. But Xavier can do something special. He can hit a golf ball. He can hit it a long way. And he can hit it into the hole. Is he the next Rory McIlroy?
 
WOMAN: Skateboarding is a popular hobby with teenagers everywhere. But in the USA, people always stop and watch a skateboarder called Tillman. Tillman is an English bulldog but he can skateboard like a person. He jumps on the skateboard and pushes it with his feet. And he's off! 
 
MAN: The Firecrackers are a group of young girls who do gymnastics. They can jump and spin and do somersaults like other gymnasts, but the Firecrackers use a skipping rope at the same time. Some people call their routine a dance, not a sport, because they use music. But some gymnastics routines use music, too. Everyone agrees that the girls are athletes, and that their routines are fun and amazing to watch.
